immediate:
1. add endstops and automated homing guidance
1. add part cooling guidance
    1. options: existing fan / aquarium pump
1. add brackets for alternative printers
1. add a 5th axis (rotating bed and mandrel options)
1. turret tool!!! (multiple print heads and inspection tools 'activated' simply by rotation of the B axis)

maybe:
1. remove bracket supporting the back of the motor by increasing rigity of the front bracket
1. try a [more widely available](https://thepihut.com/products/bipolar-stepper-motor-with-planet-gear-box-18kg-cm) motor-gearbox combo but lower gear ratio (is microstepping enough?)

next:
1. templates/guides for community contribution
1. further demos and docs for automated 4- and 5-axis toolpath generation with FullControl
    - combine with stl import... still not 'slicing' but using geometric data in a range of ways
1. conversions that can utilise the existing controller board for printers
1. conversions of non-bed-slinger printers
